# CATS & DOGS Distribution Across US
The Power BI project aims to analyze and visualize the distribution of cats and dogs in the United States, focusing on distinguishing between household pets and wild populations. The project will integrate diverse datasets, including pet registration databases, wildlife surveys, and census information, to explore the spatial distribution of cats and dogs across different regions, states, and urban areas. The goal is to create interactive and insightful dashboards that provide a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of household pets versus wild populations of cats and dogs. This analysis will assist policymakers, animal welfare organizations, and researchers in identifying areas with higher concentrations of stray or feral animals, facilitating targeted efforts for effective pet management and conservation strategies.
